# TMDB Frontend Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the TMDB Frontend Application project! This project aims to create a dynamic and interactive web application that leverages the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to provide users with comprehensive information about movies, TV shows, and actors. Over the next four weeks, you will work collaboratively to build a feature-rich frontend application using ReactJS and various modern libraries.

   cd TMDB-Nemanja-and-Jonathan
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure

- **src**
  - **components**: Reusable components such as `MovieCard`, `PersonCard`, etc.
  - **pages**: Pages of the application like `Home`, `Movies`, `TVShows`, `People`, `Favorites`, etc.
